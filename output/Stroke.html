<h2>Involuntary Movements After Stroke</h2>
<ul>
<li>Involuntary movements occur in 1-4% of stroke patients.</li>
<li>They can occur after ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes affecting the basal ganglia, thalamus, or their connections.</li>
<li>Hemichorea-hemiballism is the most common movement disorder after stroke in adults.</li>
<li>Dystonia is the most common movement disorder after stroke in children.</li>
<li>Other movement disorders include tremor, myoclonus, asterixis, stereotypies, and vascular parkinsonism.</li>
<li>Some movements occur immediately after stroke, while others develop later or progressively.</li>
<li>Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include neuronal plasticity, functional diaschisis, and age-related differences in brain metabolism.</li>
<li>There are no established guidelines for managing post-stroke movement disorders due to their heterogeneity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stroke Prevention: Managing Modifiable Risk Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stroke mortality has decreased, but remains preventable.</li>
<li>Major modifiable risk factors include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco smoking, hyperlipidemia, obesity, poor diet/nutrition, and physical inactivity.</li>
<li>The article reviews current recommendations for managing each of these risk factors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stroke Mimics and Stroke Chameleons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accurate stroke diagnosis is crucial for interventional therapies, which carry potential adverse effects.</li>
<li>Stroke mimics are non-cerebrovascular diseases that present with neurological symptoms similar to stroke.</li>
<li>Stroke chameleons are strokes with atypical or uncommon symptoms that suggest diseases other than stroke.</li>
<li>Detailed history taking, comprehensive neurological examination, and appropriate imaging studies are essential for identification.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stroke in Young Patients: A Growing Concern</h2>
<ul>
<li>Recent data shows increasing rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes in young patients.</li>
<li>The article provides an overview of current literature on premature stroke.</li>
<li>It highlights directions for future research on this emerging health issue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Secondary Stroke Prevention: Strategies and Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>Stroke is a leading cause of disability and a major cause of mortality globally.</li>
<li>One in four strokes is recurrent.</li>
<li>Secondary stroke prevention starts with understanding the stroke mechanism.</li>
<li>Control of vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking cessation) is essential.</li>
<li>Lifestyle modifications (healthy diet, aerobic exercise) are recommended.</li>
<li>Anticoagulation is the mainstay of therapy for cardioembolism due to atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or cardiac thrombus.</li>
<li>The role of anticoagulation is less clear for bioprosthetic valves, patent foramen ovale, and dilated cardiomyopathy with low ejection fraction.</li>
<li>Surgical intervention for symptomatic extracranial carotid stenosis seems beneficial.</li>
<li>Medical therapy for intracranial large artery atherosclerosis includes antiplatelets, high-dose statins, aggressive vascular risk factor control, and lifestyle modifications.</li>
<li>Treatment for small artery occlusion (lacunar stroke) is similar to that for intracranial large artery atherosclerosis.</li>
<li>Despite advances, stroke recurrence remains high, highlighting the need for novel therapies.</li>
