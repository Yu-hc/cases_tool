<h2>Dementia: Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dementia is a syndrome characterized by cognitive decline affecting daily functioning.</li>
<li>Multiple causes exist, including neurological, neuropsychiatric, and medical conditions.</li>
<li>Neurodegenerative dementias (Alzheimer's, Lewy bodies) are prevalent in the elderly, while traumatic brain injury and tumors are common in younger adults.</li>
<li>Despite advancements in neuroimaging and biomarkers, disease-modifying therapies are still awaited.</li>
<li>Clinicians play a crucial role in alleviating suffering, treating contributing conditions, managing symptoms, promoting brain health, and improving quality of life for patients and families.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment of Dementias</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dementia treatment is a neglected area of neurological care for the elderly.</li>
<li>Individual interventions may have modest effects, but combined therapies can significantly improve quality of life.</li>
<li>Given the widespread impact of dementia, effective therapies hold substantial societal implications.</li>
<li>Current treatment focuses on mitigating cognitive and behavioral consequences, as disease-modifying therapies are unavailable.</li>
<li>Strategies aim to minimize harm to patients with dementia.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Young-Onset Dementia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Young-onset dementia affects individuals under 65 years of age, often misdiagnosed.</li>
<li>A systematic approach involving medical history, collateral information, neuropsychological testing, laboratory studies, and neuroimaging aids diagnosis.</li>
<li>Differential diagnosis is extensive, including early-onset neurodegenerative conditions (Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy bodies, Huntington's, prion disease).</li>
<li>Late-onset childhood neurodegenerative conditions (mitochondrial disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, leukodystrophies) may also present as young-onset dementia.</li>
<li>Potentially reversible causes (inflammatory disorders, infections, toxic/metabolic abnormalities, transient epileptic amnesia, obstructive sleep apnea, normal pressure hydrocephalus) are crucial considerations.</li>
<li>This review provides etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and management options for young-onset dementia.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Young-Onset Dementia: A Heterogeneous Spectrum</h2>
<ul>
<li>Young-onset dementia encompasses various dementias with onset before age 65.</li>
<li>These include primary dementias (Alzheimer's, frontotemporal, vascular), genetic/familial dementias, metabolic disorders, and secondary dementias (alcohol use disorder, traumatic brain injury, infections).</li>
<li>Presentation is diverse, involving cognitive, psychiatric, and neurological symptoms.</li>
<li>Diagnostic delay is common, with frequent confusion between young-onset dementia and psychiatric conditions.</li>
<li>Thorough assessment is recommended, including collateral history, neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, neuropsychology, and genetic testing.</li>
<li>Management requires an age-appropriate, multidisciplinary approach, timely access to services, and family involvement.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Functional Cognitive Disorder: Reframing Cognitive Difficulties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Functional cognitive difficulties are increasingly recognized, characterized by internal inconsistency.</li>
<li>Impairing or distressing symptoms not explained by other disorders can be conceptualized as functional cognitive disorder (FCD).</li>
<li>FCD is likely prevalent but may be underdiagnosed.</li>
<li>The term "mild cognitive impairment" (MCI) encompasses various causes, including FCD.</li>
<li>A proportion of MCI cases do not progress to dementia, suggesting non-neurodegenerative processes.</li>
<li>MCI "non-progressors" lack diagnostic specificity, highlighting limitations of a solely neurodegenerative framework.</li>
<li>Depression, anxiety, and behavioral changes can precede neurodegeneration, and further research is needed to explore this relationship in FCD.</li>
<li>Viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a broad differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components like FCD, improves study efficacy and patient outcomes.</li>
<li>This paper defines functional neurological disorder-cognitive subtype, explains its position within other cognitive diagnoses and biomarkers, and highlights clinical features for diagnosis.</li>
<li>Positive identifiers of FCD improve recognition of individuals not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, facilitating personalized interventions.</li>
